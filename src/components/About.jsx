      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm someone who finds joy in spending time with family and friends, as they keep me grounded and balanced. I have a strong passion for problem-solving, always looking for creative solutions to challenges. A food enthusiast at heart, I love exploring different cuisines. I strive to live a peaceful and devotional life, which helps me stay focused and calm.</p>
      <p> Movies have always been a source of inspiration for me, and I've recently started exploring animeâ€”Naruto being a personal favorite. In my free time, I enjoy driving and traveling to new places, as it fuels my sense of adventure and curiosity.</p>
